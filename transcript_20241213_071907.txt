 Okay, so this is the version two. I just wanted to basically update it so that it would be able to, you know, record me from the start. And then at the end, it would be able to just give me a final transcription because right now it misses information by chunking it into two seconds at a time. Like right there, it said Chong, that is not a word. So I'm hoping that by doing this, it kind of gives you a live transcription, but then at the very end it will give you a full transcription that is much more accurate. So we will cancel it right there and give it a try.
